# Great-Value-SSX

The world has been hit with that dank angle, and everything is on a hill. You have to traverse through cities collecting items on a sick
snowboard and make it to the end. Of course it wouldnt be an SSX game without some sick tricks and some nasty pipes to hit. You can also
tag up the street with your own logo to signify that this is your territory.

## Features

Some of the features in this game is that we used Mapbox to pull in real layouts of the cities and mountains to add to the realism to our
game. It also has a server-side so you can play and compete with your friends!

Here is the link to the free SDK we used

Here is the software we used to build some of the assets

We also decided to add our own personality throughout the game with the colorful skybox, meme-ish items, and some audio cue's when you hit
that STYLISH trick.

## Concept

The whole concept of our game is for you to skate/snowboard down a hill, collecting items, and reach a high score by hitting tricks or
collecting items. Our game is heavily physics based so most of our efforts went into getting that right and it's communicating to the
server.
